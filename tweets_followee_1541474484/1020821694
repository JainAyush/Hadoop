RT @SexLoveScopes: Even though #Pisces may follow better than lead. They're tougher than they seem &amp; will fight for what they truly believe…

I never gave up hope cause I know one day this will be all over .
Sometimes I smile so I don't have to show how I really feel . I hate letting people know I have problems .
Never let a hater see you down 👌
When you get sad , you can't help but think about "Sad" situations .
Make me laugh , make me happy , &amp; make me love again ♥️
Live everyday as if it was your last because it could be your last .

I'm tired of isolating myself , it's time to start having fun .
Money is the motive .
But for now I'm just focused on school &amp; getting a new job .
Never gonna get anywhere with that attitude .
I always complain about being single but never allow myself to get to know anyone . How does that work ?
You just can't trust anybody anymore . Not even family .
Sometimes the truth hurts , but at least you didn't lie .
RT @PiscesAreUs: When dating a #Pisces, make sure they never find out about your ulterior sex motive. Just keep it pleasant.
Somebody always has to be worried about the next .

I refuse to be that girl everybody has had cause it takes someone very special to even have a chance .
