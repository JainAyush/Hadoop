Can me and cait re-live 3.3.14 please?! @bastillephan
Cause I have about 38-40 bastille songs on my phone and some of there covers
Cause my phone is a android phone, so I can get free music apps. And I had to search up songs separately. Which was a pain
I was so happy when I found laughter lines tho...
And I am not lieing. The first song I heard by bastille was Laura Palmer. Then I searched up bastille and got bad blood...
I Love bad Blood way way way way too much. It's my fav song. And the first song I got on my phone by bastille tbh....
