@roboform I am literally checking every week Roboform website, for new iOS and OSX apps.
@roboform looking forward to it. I own 3 desktop licences and full iOS version would be incredible. Truly most intelligent pw manager RF. üòé
@roboform trying out other password managers made me really appreciate Roboform.  But again no full IOS app and no wifi sync is killing me.
@roboform lack of those features forces me to use much inferior 1password 4 that cant even remember forms.
@roboform mac version is not as versatile as pc version. Would love to have ios full version, not RF everywhere and synch-able by wifi.
@Techmoan have you reviewed GS608 ? Almost identical to Ambarella Mini 0801 but at its half price.
@Advania_is are you planning to have domain registration services and dns services? I would rather have domains and hosting in save region.
@IDrive_Online i found thanks. One sugg: direct link from initial ui to ios images would be great instead of going through folder hierarchy.
@IDrive_Online as much as I like u, seriously lack iOS usability. Camera Roll or its folder can‚Äôt be auto synced. select 1 by 1 to upload :/
@TeamViewer_help is there teamviewer QS add on for LG phones? Currently I can not control LG with mouse. Only shows stats, chat and apps
@TekSavvyNetwork  or this clusterf... http://t.co/bBvORxnS55

@Greenqloud do you have email support? You seem to be using Zendesk which is a US company which means all client data and chat stored in US
@Greenqloud privatly funded (by who?) your main appeal is you aren't supposed to store data USA &amp; your cloud DC DigitalFortress is in USA. üëé
@Greenqloud are you fully Icelandic company or are you partially owned by USA or any other countries corporation.

@brackets one significant feature keeps brackets under dev radar is s lack of split view. Sublime text is ahead in this.
@brackets is split view planned? I don't see any option atm for having two files visible at the same time. Unless i am missing something.
@mysms most important is 1. How does app manage and integrate sms with mobile data, Wifi &amp; mobile carrier. Is it local or worldwide.
@mysms it feels like you purposely beating around bush and avoiding the most important questions regarding app's channels of communication
@TekSavvyNetwork cable service down in north york?
@cfjedimaster no, it's a photoshop mockup.  Recently discovered @brackets haven't done any coding on or for it yet.
@brackets optional icons in front of file type for "glance recognition".like komodo edit show/hide icons. Mocup: http://t.co/2mNncx05c2
@joostschuur @brackets Good change! Surprisingly no typical software ad acoustic guitar with hippies clapping "happiest day ever" music.
@brackets difference between coda2 and brackets sidebar. In Brackets all files types and folders look identical. http://t.co/2foYJLJ95e
@Brackets any way to make sidebar file list stand out more? File names are way too dark almost blends with sidebar bg.
@airmailer is Airmail App an email aggregator sort if like proxy or is it a direct email app connecting user directly with provider?
Today jus hit me that my email data has better chance for privacy if its hosted in Russia then North America or EU. wow... #privacy #russia
@opera Opera Mail - is there a way of making Subject of received emails Bold? (Same way apple mail. App has)
@IDrive_Online so instead of showing start point folder for path. Let us access end point folder where actual files are stored in out of box
@IDrive_Online OOB feature suggestion: Give user, viewing option of all out of box end folders in single view. No endless path clicking...
