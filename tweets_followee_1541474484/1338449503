Well, if you've got the keys, then start the car
And drive as far as you can.
Making small stabs in passing
But the pain is bigger than it seems
Stop holding me under and let me breathe...
Punk bitch walking tall like you got something to prove
Nah man, cause deep down you know it sucks to be you
I am the ocean, I am the sea. There is a world inside of me.
Fear couldn't place its hands on us, my dear.
Piece it all together now, because I sell myself short every time.
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear- death is the only salvation you'll feel.
Show me a sign, show me a reason to give a solitary fuck about your goddamn beliefs.
The future's just a few heartbeats away from disaster.
When did the diamonds leave your bones?
As times like this run up my wrist,
she hates all of the guts and blood.
Splash around with me while we move like flames on burning sheets.
