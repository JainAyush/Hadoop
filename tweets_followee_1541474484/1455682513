You know I'm comfortable with u when:   I'm weird with u I sing whatever song comes into my mind I say what's on my mind  I talk nonsense.
I'll never understand why I love when people say my name in a text so much

hahaha #Goodafternoon
I'm so pumped for summer but at the same time the thought of it makes me want to throw up because I do not have a body made for summer
if u think it's "too gay" to do nice things for a girl, you're probably "too immature" for a relationship anyway
