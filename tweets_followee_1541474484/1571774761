Go Team Epoch!!  Despite Wyatt being turd about being chosen for the elimination challenge, I have faith he can beat Jesse. #OppositeWorlds
Wyatt needs to suck it up, grow a pair, &amp; be a team player! Don't be such a big baby just because you didn't want to go in! #OppositeWorlds
Lauren is a wonderful diplomat, weighing everyone's opinions before making her decision if she is chosen as the Decider.  #OppositeWorlds

Cronos may have won the challenge, but they are not a unified team.  The harsh conditions Epoch is in only binds them more. #OppositeWorlds
Jesse and Frank are the BIGGEST douche b's EVER!! #OppositeWorlds
Team Cronos is a bunch of whiney, poor sport douche b's!! Go Team Epoch!!  #OppositeWorlds
Yay Angela!  Team Epoch kicks ass!! #OppositeWorlds
I hope Rachel goes down!  Go Angela!!!  #OppositeWorlds
