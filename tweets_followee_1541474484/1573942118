BOTH OF THE DOPPLEGANGERS SHOULD GET TOGETHER ID DIE OF HAPPINESS OMFG IM SO HAPPY RN
AMARA IS ALIVE OMFG IM SCREAMING I LOVE TVD
THE WAY STEFAN AND ELENA COMMUNICATED AND RAN TOGETHER
RT @tvdfancentral: omfg the dress katherine wore &gt;&gt;

RT @biebersdobrev: elena doesn't deserve damon at all man
RT @itslegitariana: Fan accounts are so much better
RT @janetpurplehaze: Ian's eyes were just so pretty in that scene. Cries.
@ohpaulvedere she better not die .
elena was trying not to cry when stefan and tessa we're flirting. i love their strong relationship.

RT @glitteryariana: Music really heals everything.
oh shut the hell up. damon ain't gonna get the girl anymore
@bitenbyklaus I wanted him first):
@bitenbyklaus GOODNIGHTüíó
the next tvd episode is on halloween :-)
i miss the old #tvd
i wanna know how some of you can be so judgmental towards stelena. ? it's suppose to be Stefan's story in tvd not everybody else's.
@delena_eva well stefan tried saving elena first before she drowned but she refused and made him save Matt, so uhm yeah.
it's time to call it a night . night.
i just wanna be in a ball and cry in a corner all day, my problems won't get better oh well I guess
i want another body to be in please? anyone?
this year, my life = dead . üî´üí£
can i just please have starbucks
I am not satisfied with the life I live and I DONT want sympathy from people or them calling me am attention hog, cause really not
i think i should call it a night, but there's so much on my mind right now.
i need support from a friend, imaginary friend, god, anybody?
lwhy must the world involve the bad luck around me. :(
soo, pretty little liars is just getting crazier by the episode .
RT @StelenaForLife: People need to get this straight.
TVD is not Damon or Elena's story
It certainly isn't Delena's story
Its not Stelena's‚Ä¶
watching icarly&amp; i miss that show. omfg come back on and supposedly there's gonna be a episode of icarly returning kinda excited ,aye :-)
i really hope stefan gets his memory back :(
you wanna know what i really miss about tvd? the old elena. i miss her so much i can't even describe it. http://t.co/PYsb8d7veV
damon, babe, i love you, but you really shouldn't be with elena it's just not right
damon might be with elena, but always remember stelena is endgame and nothing will ever mess up their feelings for each other
if you didn't know.. i'm a stelena fan
If you don't like spoilers don't look at this photo. SORRY DELENA FANS, but hopefully this trivia is true. :-) http://t.co/lkNicgNixB
what would life be like if there was no stelena http://t.co/Vnm2f6mpxY
stelena needs to be trending right now
Elena will now be determined to get Stefan to know her again, I can't wait. The love she still has for him is priceless. :)
stelena will be one again, soon
now that elena is confused on why stefan doesn't know anybody, she's gonna try all her hardest to gain his memory, she doesn't wanna losehim

RT @msgranger_: i had a dream my life would be so different from this hell I'm living.
i love how stefan is the threat to damon and elena's relationship.
someone said "Damon deserved the girl" .. no stefan deserved her, but Damon wanted her, Damon deserves another girl, Stefan deserves Elena.
