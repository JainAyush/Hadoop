@TaylerJesse become a polygamist and marry both -that's what I'm going to do haha 😉
But the devil doesn't go after the wicked does he?
Staying positive all the time has gotten old, but wallowing in self-pity just isn't my style.

These steroids have my face on a whole new level of flushed an chunky... 5 months in. One more to go. All kinds of beautiful tho.
It was everything we wanted it to be. Summer of 19 you and me. &lt;3
If only "spending daddy's money" was a major in college.. I'm good at that. oh wait I'll be spending his money going there.. See point taken
That makes it alright... Right?
Did my mom just let me but 3 new coach purses?!? OMG I'm an ADDICT. 😮 they where on sale tho... An it was an outlet store..
I still need to pack....... Too early for all this
Curiosity killed the cat....
Don't ever research your disease. Just don't. Sometimes it's better not to know. Ignorance is bliss.
I hate packing... But Tennessee tomorrow!!!!!:)
The fact that my dad let me blow $$$ at B&amp;N for books to "take my mind off things" an I get the most depressing books ever. #storyofmylife

RT @itsGreatGatsby: God knows who belongs in your life and who doesn't. Trust and let go. Whoever is meant to be there, will still be there.
I just found out there's no such thing as a real world-just a lie you've got to rise above. 🎶
Starting to think my purpose on this earth is to counsel those kids. I've been there. I sympathize.
Saw a kid w/ his mask on 2day headed to the 5th floor. I'm 17 an went through 2 rounds of chemo. He's 8. I'd take his place if I could.
I just read the entirety of my reading gala book in a day... Haven't been hooked like that in ages..
To think I'd been racking my mind for months.
Well everything makes a lot more sense now.... I think I'm still in shock. 😶
I don't think I have yet to make a full week of school. Next week won't be the exception either. #doctorsappt #tests:( #sickgirlprobz
Sheltered kid probs...
They freak when I go outside an walk alone... I hate to break it to them but in like 5 months I'm going to be living by myself- 2 hours away
my mom is the best. Hands down.
Comes home from the Galt House to be told that we're going to Gatlinburg for Spring break:) #traveling
@Kristyn2014 good☺️ love you too gorgeous!!! Btw did you get that solo?
When the lab guy tries to flirt with my mom in front of me while drawing my blood- not cool man. She's married to my daddy bruh. #nochance
When you think rainbow -it's usually pretty. In the lab world it means a bunch of tubes and a lot of blood. #imusetoit #labjargon
I've adopted this "I don't care/I give up" attitude because it just doesn't matter to me anymore. I've got bigger problems than this.
Excited about going to the doctor tomorrow cause mommys promised me cheesecake💛😜 #theybribeme
@BigAyyy feeling pretty good actually! It's nice to be getting back to school.. Never thought I'd say that lol
@BigAyyy that's a lie Ashley your gorgeous!!

@Kristyn2014 so does mine!!! 😬 but I don't really run like I say I do but I really just walk an sometimes jog haha
The one time I'm being actually productive on the computer and it's trippin. #essayprobs #toshibaprobs
Too bad @MackieManley isn't going to the Galt house with me this week... Who's going to go down the escalator with me Elf style? 😢

Walking always makes me happy. #bubblymood #day2 #gettingback2me

I hate the fact that emotionally I've never been stronger but physically I'm still weak. An I have a tendency to overdo things.#bedrest2day
Waking up from a good dream an not being able to get back to sleep, but still feel exhausted.. 😫😔
Bouts to get my 12+ hours of sleep.. Peace✌️
The fact that I feel great all day an then I crash. An I crash hard. #achy#whinney#complaining#wegnerscankissit

RT @DreamyCorner: Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.
Just taught myself algebra an French.. I'm a boss. Feeling quite accomplished today! http://t.co/BEPSJOMNG0
Except I'm not a quitter. I persevere -nothing like some mental math to spice up my morning. 😏
How am I suppose to teach myself this stuff😬😬😬😩😩😩😳😳😳
If your calculator dies on you while doing algebra 3, it's a sign to just give up right? -I'm taking it as a sign. I give up.
The fact that she comes up with metaphors on life that fit mine completely.. I'm so glad to have my Big Mack back;) @MackieManley
Can't believe I'm saying this but I actually miss school. March can't come soon enough!
Funny how the memories sound like a melody like a sound track to a July Saturday night.. Springsteen. #countryflow #myfave
But my mom says I have a way with words...
Thinking about majoring in creative writing.. Except I've never let anyone read any of my journals.. That could be a problem.
RT @noelle_xoxox: I'm complicated 💁

Why is teaching myself french so hard... Cause I only know English, an my wonderful Mrs. Caswell isn't here to help me:(
The only relationship I don't need to work on is the one I have with my heating pad. Gods Gift to my sore &amp; achy body.
