@lakhilakhi5 @helenzille shame! I don't think so.probably sir promised u hand in marriage.
@lakhilakhi5 @helenzille The word "impimpi" is implemented by corrupted @ANC leaders.
@lakhilakhi5 @helenzille what did @Zuma promise? I c now:-)
@lakhilakhi5 @helenzille u started something u couldn't finish,stop accusing innocent people without facts.
@lakhilakhi5 @helenzille how did other politicians assassinated with so called bodyguards around them?
@lakhilakhi5 @helenzille so misusing state fund is justifiable?
@lakhilakhi5 @helenzille the only vindictive people I know It's @EEF leader.
@lakhilakhi5 @helenzille I don't blame @procecutors 4 brainwashing us is due to their safety.
@twieterazzi gud! However as we thought we liberated,then Particles of @ANC abuse our @Loyalty.
@KickOffMagazine Phefeni boys like it or not.

@Lebza777 who r they? Tell me do u watch European national teams? Do u know these players how many caps do they have for their country?
@Lebza777 what I'm saying is, u can't change team unnecessarily for the sake of satisfying everyone.
@Lebza777 that's why de likes of @Barcelona&amp;Bayen r so dangerous with consistent starting 11.
@Lebza777 no! Lebza it doesn't work like that in soccer,chop and changing kills team momentum n u can't get positive results like that.
@Lebza777 isn't it what @Baxter doing at @Kaizer_Chiefs ?
@Lebza777 those predictable teams.
@Lebza777 what r they supposed to do?
@YesWeCrann #SLnews I hope his absence had nothing to do with disciplinary problems,bcz on the field he's marvelous to watch

@kolowang. Clearly,@ANC leaders r in fond of corrupt Presi instead of fair one.that's why I say obviously@Mbeki wasn't in love with favors
So if @Oscar didn't pull trigger 4 his gun, as a owner whom is control of his gun he must take a blame,easy as that.
RT @FloMasebe: Everybody gets blamed by Oscar. Now even the gun is being blamed for discharging itself while he was holding it at Tashas.
@HlomlaDandala Ok my apology 4 misunderstanding sir!

@Kaizer_Chiefs good luck to @khosiboys:-)
@Vavi@Malema were front runners to remove@Mbeki,where de fuck r they now?@malema even boasted 2 lead @ANC one day ,@Vavi's cry foul now.
Now all these @khayelitsha idiot protesters,they blame @Zille for Poor service delivery,@Inkandla's budget could've wiped their tears.
What worse did @Mr Mbeki do 2b unseated like that comparing to @Zuma's government? Clearly something is wrong with this fuck'n @ANC:-(
It's clear some of @ANC idiots they unseated @Mr Mbeki due 2 their empty pockets,now they r feasting themselves with @Zuma.
