@BrigoLOTRO Aye, don't forget Anniversary festival and rewards coming soon.
@ihartsnape @cableknitdragon thanks! Giving that a try this evening.
@ihartsnape just for PC if they have it
@cableknitdragon * feels strange irresistible compulsion to purchase game now"
@toarda Yes, I discovered that if you keep going out into the future sea, one will perish. I was  just too curious...
@toarda We need to organize a sandcastle / sand construction building event in #Landmark. Have you been to the sea shore? Possibilities...
Philip Jose Farmer's "Riverworld" series plus complete works. So little spare time though. Summer reading. Box set. http://t.co/1WwrKEfoeM
@ihartsnape So, Lego hobbit - how do you like it so far? It's compelling me to purchase, yet, I haven't succumbed to the power of the ring.
@toarda Thought you might appreciate this  from Texas Sandfest sandcastle competition. Pie themed sand construction. http://t.co/SuVF1CbxlO
@AvMists hope things have cooled down for you. Supposed to be  27C today nicest weather of the year is Spring in Texas!
@AvMists thanks. I just stopped right there, and was amazed at the way it looked. I do that often in game. Amazing artwork
Thanks @lotro game devs and artists. Outstanding!  @rickheaton give them a clap on the back for me, please. : O ) http://t.co/VzYE1HtWEy
A sublime moment in the Rushgore. http://t.co/JGZpGr20Bk
More detail from Ost Celebrant. Thanks @lotro for such wonderful detail and artwork! http://t.co/Mqilg4ZaJ2
Light and textures seemed amazing at Ost Celebrant. Well done @lotro game developers and artists! http://t.co/dh4v8oGhGc
@OGormanDaily It's going to be great! Really, really great... in a hobbity, dwarvish, sort of way! (hm. just "really great" sounded better).
@AvMists Oi! If you run into Dean O'Gorman @OGormanDaily please give him a clap on the back from Texas. (New Zealand's not to far right?)lol
Seen Dean O"Gorman's (Fili from movie The Hobbit) tweets about upcoming HobbitCon in Bonn? Oi! Just one more &amp;^%*ing week! @OGormanDaily
Second breakfast: accomplished. Oh it is good to be home in The Shire!
Well, I've left Minas Tirith behind for a couple days. I hope there's still some pie left in the larder when I get home.

@cableknitdragon They did indeed bring good weather. 26C / 79F today. Fine Hobbity day! Oh yes, and 2 kinds of pie!
The Ents have come up close to the clearing this morning. What ever they're saying it will likely take days to say. http://t.co/1NYLw0b8DJ
2 kids digging on the playground. I asked them what they were doing. They said making a Hobbit hole. I gave them pie...and stamp of approval
@toarda I voted so many likes for your beautiful creations! They are just breathtaking and amazing! The screen shots don't do them Justice.
Sometimes one just wishes to sit on the roof and eat pie. @CountessCelkat @BrandywineFred @AvMists @cableknitdragon
@toarda I noticed a great deal of hillside where one could construct a smials of sorts. We need a Three Farthing Stone, though...
@toarda I must confess, I did not venture into the glittering cave to far... I was thinking perhaps I should wait for a guide...
@toarda I was sad to have missed you, but carefully made my way around to see everything. Breathtakingly beautiful...
@toarda Berry! It is breathtaking! I saw all your creations, the mushrooms, the White Dragon Inn, the glittering caves!
@toarda lol! Yes. It's not just a pretty blue crystal in the air at the portal spire. I was looking all over in T1 for your spot lol!
@toarda Berry, please disregard my DM. I figured it out.One would think being a mathematician, one would not have these "duh" moments..
@toarda @AvMists 3:45 AM weekdays! Duty at Minas Tirith, Orcs, Goblins, Saruman's treachery, Stone Trolls... The usual weekday sort of thing
@toarda @flosiin26 I'll send you some when our birthday month rolls around. : )
@BrigoLOTRO @toarda Thanks... going to try that now.  : )
@toarda made it into landmark. Graphics very laggy, so had to switch to low everything. I'll try again tomorrow. So want to see white dragon
@toarda @BrigoLOTRO I'll be the one named BrollioTook. : ) still installing. Had to stop a couple times.
@toarda Installing Landmark now...  : O )
@toarda @CountessCelkat @AvMists @cableknitdragon  The deed is done - the fritter has been cast down, and vanquished! Hobbits:1  Fritters: 0
Apple fritter, you lay slain on the field of battle. Now the crown goes to the victor, and this Hobbit shall be know as Fritter Slayer.

"So you're saying you don't think I can eat 2 apple fritters for lunch today?" It is a mistake to under estimate the appetite of Hobbits!
Being a Hobbit means one can eat an apple fritter for lunch, and no one judges you.  : O )  @CountessCelkat @AvMists @cableknitdragon

@BrigoLOTRO @toarda Delightful. Moon Pies - they still make them... though there's little to them that is like Pie. Well done!

"One thing drives out another..." Barliman. I'm driving to work way too early.
@toarda Yes,but had they given us a ring, someone like the Gaffer would have been there to turn it down. "I don't take to ring-mongery"! :)
So Bob has come back from Staddle (and none too soon). He's consumed 5 pies, 2 seed cakes, and 4 pints of ale. A great deal of work he says.
It was a fine muddy, rainy day. Just the sort needed for... Well, um, let's see- ... Ducks and swine.
@BrandywineFred Bob Bolger here- Mr. Brollio wanted me to let you know I'm hale and whole. (Can I go now? And why is all this necessary?)
Rain and gloom. Or was it gloom and rain? I can't recall, but it was a great day for napping if one had time for that. Blue skies where r u?

@toarda Good night (good early morning) to you dear Berry! I am falling asleep standing up, long day at Minas Tirith. Zzzzz.
@toarda Well you know, I like EU servers -splendid fine folk! I should be around this weekend- sneaking off from Minas Tirith (shhh).  : 0 )
Well I simply cannot settle for a pop-tart -whatever that treat is... Pie cannot be equated with such fare. *sigh*
Now where did those pies get off to? I had a full larder just yesterday... @BrandywineFred ????
@toarda I'm worried all the claims will leave little choice for us late comers. : 0 (
I wanted a fine Hobbit stew for dinner this evening. Instead, I had Lembas. Sufficient yet entirely unsatisfying. Remedy: Pie! @toarda
@CountessCelkat Alas. I cannot return to Hobbiton this evening. My duties at Minas Tirith are too pressing. I hope all is well with the kin.

Well I was right. It was a 3-pie day. Thanks to my friends for adding pies! Indebted to you all! @toarda @BrandywineFred @CountessCelkat
@BrandywineFred @toarda @CountessCelkat AND... They aren't H.Hornblower's. Here's a fork for each hand...

@toarda @eldaeriel Yes. When I first heard of that, I was thinking of how we could add things like our favorite poems from Tolkien! : O )
@Floradine_S right. I forget which MMO allows used to create "books" or written items such that other users can open those items and read it
How is a Hobbit like me supposed to concentrate on working from home, when all I keep thinking about is my pie safe???
@LOTROHerebrand I'm not sure... it apparently appears rarely in the Enedwaith area.
@toarda One more question (sorry): can you create books or written work to put in the dwellings?
@toarda I'm so impressed with what you've done. I was concerned about how long it took you to create these marvelous dwellings, though.
@toarda Ah! I see. It's stunningly beautiful. About how much time would you say it took to create the White Dragon?
@toarda So... This means you'll have to rebuild The White Dragon and all the other lovely things you've created at the end of March?
@conscioushours @rwfrk @Bludborn Ah! I believe you are correct! That was where it appeared first for me.
@conscioushours @rwfrk @Bludborn Thanks for the info. I have not encountered that particular art work before though. Strange.
@toarda Very heartfelt, and true. You are still a dear friend no matter where you go.
@CountessCelkat @flosiin26 Great minds all have similar beginnings.  : O ))
@CountessCelkat @flosiin26 I used to read Andre Norton when I was in 7th or 8th grade. Very nostalgic sci-fi reads. Fav:Daybreak 2250
@CountessCelkat @cableknitdragon They need a damage over time effect for corrupted pie filling. : O )
@flosiin26 What about those old sci-fi novels that Andre Norton worte? any favs there?
@toarda Thank you, Berry. So sad today - I am eating comfort food now. Pie of course.
I should be working online this afternoon, but all I really want to do is finish some more quests, and maybe go back and work on my crafting
@SoncaGH I know... I almost missed the chance to screen shot it, as per the progress bar nearly full.
@cableknitdragon Oh.. yes. Here I am after lofting the pie into one of the upper level windows - completely ignored. http://t.co/vXn8eXU2zo
I just realized I have taken 1,145 screen shots, as of last evening. I need a dedicated hard drive just for screen shots. : O /
I've been playing LOTRO for several years now, and this is the first time I've ever seen this art work. New? http://t.co/T5IByaoDMy
I tried backing up, but I was firmly stuck in the dark rock of Orthanc's roots. http://t.co/xNV8wYLHnr
Whilst exploring Isengard, I got stuck in a rock wall. Not sure what happened here... likely some trickery of Sarumon http://t.co/N8C5AgLgug
I was entirely disappointed though that I couldn't enter Orthanc. Did Sarumon not hear me knocking on the door??? http://t.co/9MxL3RzL67
So impressive (I know I'm so behind, just now exploring Isengard), the closer I got to Orthanc. http://t.co/yMhf2vtt3W
Well I took myself to Isengard (being a Hobbit and all). This was my 1st view. I was hoping Saruman would be home. http://t.co/3ykeLrcmwM

@cableknitdragon The entire game is a bit nostalgic for me... and now Berry has gone. I'm a sad hobbit today...
@BrandywineFred Same experience with my minstrel. I wish there was an option to revert to older versions of the game. I'd go back to MoM...
@toarda Berry, I've read your post on http://t.co/dIrLtp1t6B. I posted my own comments, and will miss you my dear friend. I am so sad now.
@toarda Are you going to be keeping http://t.co/dIrLtp1t6B going?

@toarda Well, your site is my favorite - Hobbits are always truthful about such things - unless a ring is involved or pie.Then it gets dicey
@shanaqui @toarda Berry's site is my overall fav!
@shanaqui I agree - Moria is astoundingly well done. #lotro Thanks lotro game developers and designers!
@shanaqui For deed maps the best source is @toarda - her site http://t.co/ZV6oApWCp4 #toarda is Whiteberry of Laurelin - she's the best!
@shanaqui Ah! Ok. Moria gets easier with time. Doing the quest chains actually teaches you the routes, and layout. It is very nonlinear tho
@shanaqui That link has quests organized sequentially, and after selecting the quest you want, you'll get to the map
@shanaqui You need a good friend to travel with you. Which server are you using?
@shanaqui Try this one: http://t.co/dVBLAW6ECQ
@shanaqui yes but they are not all available on every site. I have to hunt around for them generally.

@toarda @Achazia_S I should think Berry is planting the seed of sorts. What a delightful corner to start one's version of The Shire in.
@toarda You are, my dearest Berry, the most remarkable Hobbit ! How lovely! Ok. I must check out #landmark at some point. Tips?
I don't recommend seeking advice on the weather from Getford the Unwise. No explanation required I should think. #SureasShireTalk
@BrandywineFred Weather is magical I should think. Even at our best we don't seem to have a clue about what it do from 1 day to the next.
@BrandywineFred wasn't blue? I distinctly recall it being a blue pointy hat, unless you mean Getford the Unwise. He had a gray pointy hat...
Freezing rain again in Houston? In March, no less? Clearly the work of Saruman again. Someone should do something! @BrandywineFred ?
Turns out Bob's in Stock visiting relatives. What I thought was Bob in a rocking chair is actually a pillow draped with his winter cloak.
Bob's been so quiet lately. One would think something's amiss.
@elfofmirkwd indeed the perfect hiding place! Lead to the game's downfall of course. Wasn't much a game after all the pies had been eaten.
@elfofmirkwd of course this was a different game than "Seeking Pies Throughout The Shire" and pre-dated the "Hobbit in the Larder" craze.
@elfofmirkwd Sneeking pie through the Shire was once a game of sorts. It was called "Sneaking a Pie Through The Shire". Quite popular!
