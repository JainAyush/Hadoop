Sunny days are suppose to be happy...... Where the hell did the happiness go?
RT @StevStiffler: hey, fuck you.
While your out being happy, I'm all alone trying to cover myself up as happy.
Nobody loves a girl with scars......
Bands are there when nobody else is.
Oh if only you knew. You might understand..... But some things are better left unsaid.
I believe it's time for me to move forward, when I break through.
Finding someone who excepts your scars 💕
I just might name my kid Olaf.
You looking at me but I'm looking through you.
I see the guilt beneath your shame, I see your soul through your window pane. I see the scars that remain.
RT @TheComedyHumor: everyone: are you okay
everyone: you look tired
everyone: you look upset
everyone: you look confused
everyone: are you …
Kids love Amanda.
Oh summer clothes, how I missed  you 🌞👏💙 http://t.co/Jkd04laxhA
I hate when people act like nothing happened. Like didn't I just say, fuck off?
I bet I'm gonna be spending my vacation with Netflix. It's sad.
Fuck your happiness.
I can't be her, but I can be me, and if that's not enough you might aswell walk away like everyone else.

Mother Nature is clearly on her period, we can see her mood swings. It was once sunny, and now I'm late for school.
Fuck bitches get snow.
Love me? No, okay 💔
I honestly wish I could say what I need to, but I can't afford to lose anyone ... Not again.
There's so much a smile can hide... 😊💬
As long as your here with me I know il be okay ❤️
Just because your broken doesn't mean you can't stand up and smile again.
Never get your hopes up. In my sad case a specially when it comes to family ...
