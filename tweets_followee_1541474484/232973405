Health a is treasure which we  should be grateful to have and keep!!!!
I think majoro can be more useful in pirates squad ,they boy is talented but he is currently playing under pressure he's heading for failure
@Pirates_Updates good luck my team ,I know u gonna make us proud,just don't be shy in front of opponents poles
@PabiMoloi its takes a real guards to do that!

What a boring friday!!!!
@Pirates_Updates the truth is our build up is good but we need to find a formula for aggression towards finishing !!!!
@rodger_sa I am sure if we maintain focus and discipline we will win they should know unnecessary rough tackles will work against us

Off from practice wouldn't mind double tot wiskey
Life is a journey u need to experience  but wise choices will save u from deepest hurt,Let ur soul embrace all ur blessing for challenges.
What a night !!!! Its so sad how africans stab and kill one another instead of having fun and go home to sleep
