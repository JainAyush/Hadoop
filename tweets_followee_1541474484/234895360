@Riversidebaking hi.  Emma is putting tables together for the Xmas do you want to be included or has David arranged something else.
@Riversidebaking will do! Thanks!
@Riversidebaking no. I turned it up and mixed the flour in. Maybe my tins are a bit big. Weird. Will not give up!
Turned out ok. @Riversidebaking http://t.co/Ls9e4N5QGR
@Riversidebaking ok cool. Going to make another layer!
@Riversidebaking the flour is maybe two months old. I think they are the right size tins. But even when I used one it didn't rise that much
@Riversidebaking no. Just self raising flour.
@Riversidebaking just realise my first tweet didn't make too much sense! #tweetingwithbakingrage
@Riversidebaking it didn't need baking powder. Using a hand mixer and then I folded the flour in. fan oven. Different recipe So annoyed!!
