*So excited for the weekend*
The weekend comes

I think that 'Fast Food' should be re-named to 'Slow Food'
I sometimes think that they're having an orgasim on the Herbal Essences advert!

RT @PrimarySklProbs: Miming the songs in assembly instead of actually singing because you were too sassy and couldn't be tamed
'Thingy,' Tell me what a 'Thingy' is please
Some people just don't have a sense of humor
Seriously, I can't read minds
RT @BritishLogic: People who consider Rich Teas as dunkable are the daredevils of this country.
RT @PrimarySklProbs: Spending the whole of your primary school life trying to get your gooey alien pregnant

I hate when people try to get into a conversation and that conversation doesn't need them 😡
