Date you? Again? Sorry #swerve
Thought I met a cool friend today..but guess not... I'm not a whore I'm not going to do stuff with you you hoeshit.
I'm kinda happy to go to school today to show him I'm strong again‚ô• but.. then I think about it I don't want to get up
I know you like someone else.but why does it hurt so much?Ive tried to be positive I've tried to move on but honestly youre home in mi heart
That moment you're in love with someone but you have that feeling he doesn't love you anymore.
Bringin out the tears again...seriously...stop.. hurting me...you've done enough...

Why can't I ever sleep anymore. Why is that getting tto me so badly? Why can't I let it go? Why can't I forget it? #kill #me #now
I've made so many mistakes in my life I need to restart a new one. You aren't helping it at all #killed #inside

You talk to me all of a sudden just for that. Hmmm thats a sign of u being desperate or u are just a whore
Never talk to me again..you're prolly blind if u can't see I'm finally happy
U asking me that made me lose respect for you #nasty

Stomach hurts &amp; migraines, can't sleep, back hurts if god is calling me I hope its soon #blahh
I hate liars! I can't find a real person in life that won't lie to me that's all real nonfake. #wtf
I love how my best friend knows exactly what I'm talking about#sister #communications
I went, had so much fun! I don't regret not going! Being there was a blast I gotta do it again! #sneaky #loveit
They need to fall asleep #blahh
Kinda scared but I hope it'll be worth it #excited
All i wanted is for you to be alive because i actually care about you #loveyou #always
The relationships that work are the ones that get work on.
Real relationships are afraid of losing each other
She/ He will accept you for you &amp; will love only you. Be #honest #truthful your relationship will last.
Everything happens for a reason don't wait for a person that doesn't like you, there's a reason god didn't put him/her in your path of life
I'm not sure if it was good i told you i liked you, but its weird you didn't make a grody sound. #ugh #schoolsucked
Knowing i made my friend happy makes another reason to fake smile to make them feel happy &amp; to hide my pain. #sad
Sometimes its okay to make the right decision only to see your loved one happy no matter how much you get hurt
Sometimes its okay
Sometimes you need to do the right thing or you'll be living a lie.
Some people waste their time thinking about the wrong person that will never be right.
