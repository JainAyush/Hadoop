RT @MoviePaul: @StephenCaggiano @RealityCrowdTV @JaxFoodCritic Here's a nice article about @BeOneSpark from @Forbes http://t.co/n1wqwyU6Np
Cool. I'll keep an eye out. @MoviePaul @RealityCrowdTV @JaxFoodCritic #OneSpark
I don't know. @RealityCrowdTV Ask @MoviePaul about that. @JaxFoodCritic #OneSpark
@JaxFoodCritic @MoviePaul For sure. The digital footprint caught my attention. #OneSpark
That's neat. @MoviePaul @JaxFoodCritic #OneSpark
So, we're talking numbers to rival the Super Bowl. @JaxFoodCritic @MoviePaul #OneSpark
Or, once a year, #Jax will be the center of the universe, because they supported this event. @MoviePaul @BeOneSpark
I would have no way of knowing. @MoviePaul @BeOneSpark
Jealous for sure. One more reason I'm kicking myself for not being in #Jacksonville this week. @hashtracking @EconTiff #OneSpark
@MoviePaul @BeOneSpark What's cool, is when the event hosts get financial offers to host there event in other cities.
@MoviePaul @BeOneSpark The common downfall seemed to be locals complaining about the crowds.
@hashtracking @EconTiff Awesome, thanks! How are YOU? #OneSpark
@MoviePaul @BeOneSpark I know the "Taste of" brand dumped a couple cities for lack of support this year.
@MoviePaul @BeOneSpark Possibly. I mean, #Jax COULD support them. But will they?
RT @RealityCrowdTV: Wonderful #onespark project @FreshJax Project No. 20076.  Vote for them!  #freshjax great food and #yoga. http://t.co/v…
Right. Because this is the first year the #OneSpark brand has gone global. @MoviePaul @BeOneSpark
RT @RealityCrowdTV: Last chance to support Reality Crowd TV at #onespark.  Please vote 20418 #jacksonville #onespark2014. http://t.co/6X3jC…
@MoviePaul As of this year, @BeOneSpark has become a global destination brand. #OneSpark
@MoviePaul Because of their model, @BeOneSpark has more appeal than #sXsw. Those numbers pale in comparison to what I believe is coming.
@MoviePaul And THAT is the kind of thinking I am talking about when I say the city has to step up. #OneSpark
That's an interesting observation. In Your opinion, is that an obstacle? @MoviePaul @BeOneSpark @MelissainJax
For sure. It's when things aren't done, that things go wrong. @MoviePaul @BeOneSpark @MelissainJax
Have not. And I'm so hopeful for #OneSpark, I thought my early call to arms might get #Jax legislators attention. @MoviePaul @MelissainJax
I worked 16 events last year. 5 of them had to relocate this year, for lack of city support. @MoviePaul @BeOneSpark @MelissainJax
Clear that @BeOneSpark is a successful brand. They'll have to make decisions that best serve their customers. @MoviePaul @MelissainJax
Both. Everyone loved #OneSpark. @MoviePaul @MelissainJax
@EconTiff You bet! I'm a big @Hashtracking fan. #OneSpark
No. I have Clients in attendance. I'll be down next year. Pretty psyched, actually. @MoviePaul @MelissainJax
cc/ @Chlj RT @EconTiff: #onespark: Buzz Words by @hashtracking http://t.co/J3LCqu1ZKU cc: @BeOneSpark @joesampsonfl @stephencaggiano
Fair enough. But as a lagging indicator, it's usually pretty sound. @MoviePaul @MelissainJax
Looking over the #SM complaints, transportation, and public restrooms stood out this year. Easy peasy fix. @MoviePaul @MelissainJax
I hope so. I love #Jacksonville. #OneSpark is my reason for coming next year. @DoeofJohn @MelissainJax
Well, kinda. The city has to really step up to keep something like this going. @MoviePaul @MelissainJax
And I hope #Jax legislators expand to support it. @dawnemerick @MelissainJax @CityofJax #OneSpark
Spot on response. I'd get to work TODAY, for next year's #OneSpark. @AbelHarding @MelissainJax
It all comes down to how fast the city can get on board. @DoeofJohn @MelissainJax @go_duval @CityofJax
It's possible. Much like #sXsw, they may have to move components of #OneSpark to other cities. @DoeofJohn @MelissainJax @go_duval @CityofJax
@MelissainJax Hope so. But if the city doesn't support the event, they'll get so many complaints, that offers from other cities will appeal.
As long as You have forward thinking legislators, already working on next year's #OneSpark, You'll be fine. @MelissainJax @CityofJax
Sometimes events like this, grow faster than a city's ability to support them. @MelissainJax @CityofJax #OneSpark
@BeOneSpark Safe to say, the @CityOfJax is really going to have to step up their game, to keep #OneSpark in #Jax next year.
