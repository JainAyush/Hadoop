But yet again that's like every Ed Sheeran picture.
Currently looking for that one Ed Sheeran picture I fall in love with.
Please don't go, I'll eat you whole. I love you so.
#breezeblocks #perfect
I wrap my hands around your neck so tight with love #upintheair
Slowly going crazy
Shopping
Going shopping #whatsmypantsize
What I love most about watching Ed perform is seeing everyone get quiet and be peaceful and enjoy it. It's not a crazy mosh pit.
Wake me if you're out there.
"I have a wife and 3 kids!"
"Good cover."
Everything. @LoveIsMyLyrics
What is wrong with your mind?
Love how @shania_snyder and I go outside clean and we come inside all muddy and dirty #giantmudhole
@LoveIsMyLyrics That song means so much to me right now.
It's alright to die, if it's the only thing you haven't tried; but hold on.
I need to stop looking at pictures of Ed Sheeran and go to sleep. *looks at more pictures of Ed Sheeran*
@LoveIsMyLyrics whenever I think of myself as weird I hear "I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK AS LONG AS IT'S ABOUT ME"
@LoveIsMyLyrics we're so weird haha :D
@LoveIsMyLyrics anytime babe :p
When I see your face I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth because you're amazing just the way you are.
All my walls stood tall painted blue, but I'll take them down and open up the door for you.
You see, the world doesn't matter to me. I'd give up all I have just to breathe the same air as you until the day I die.
I don't care what you think as long as it's about me.
Listen to my voice, it's my disguse.
You cut me wide open like landscape.
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be.
@LoveIsMyLyrics Can I just text you??
