Undertaker can not retire a looser at #WrestleMania there was no way that was in the script! #MassiveFuckUp
#WrestleMania was unreal! But the more I watch the taker match, the more I think either there was a bad injury or the ref fucked up! #WWE

Any #nufc player who says they try week in week out are clearly lying! Yeah #efc were good tonight, I've seen Newcastle play a lot better!
So if there's new people going into the #GeordieShore house has anyone left? @GeordieShore__
#nufc no pace in this side at all! Were fucked without Remy!!
