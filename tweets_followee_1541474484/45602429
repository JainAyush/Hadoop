To be honest, you're the only one i've ever spent this much time and effort on.
I forgive people, but thαt doesn't meαn I trust them.
Too many basic hoes, not enough classy women. Too many dumb niggas, not enough distinguished gentlemen. Too much hate, not enough loyalty
People should take the word "promise" more serious..
Dear me, HEAD UP, stay strong. A FAKE SMILE, and move on.
Someone who truly loves you, sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, and how hard you can be to handle, but still wants you.
98% of my contacts are useless. 98% of my followers are strangers. 98% of my friends are fake. 98% of my feelings are hidden.

RT @LoveQuotes: I feel really happy when I see you, because when I look at you and see your smile, it also makes me have a smile.
RT @LoveQuotes: A smile doesn't always mean a person is happy. Sometimes it simply means they are strong enough to face their own problems.
RT @LoveQuotes: Every relationship has its problems but what makes it perfect is when you still want to be there when everything sucks.
RT @LoveQuotes: Sometimes, you have to smile, pretend everything is okay, and just walk away.
RT @LoveQuotes: A true relationship is when you can tell each other anything and everything. No secrets and no lies
RT @LoveQuotes: When you accept someone, you need to accept their past too.
RT @LoveQuotes: I love you because you make me feel like I mean something to someone.
RT @LoveQuotes: Love is accepting people for who they are, no matter what.

No matter how hard things get or how many people that I feel are against me I will never go back or turn back.

Life is short. Smile while you still have teeth.
Life without you is like; Facebook without friends, Youtube without videos, and Google with no result.
I canÕt read lips unless theyÕre touching mine.
Love is like war: Easy to begin, hard to end and never to forget.
