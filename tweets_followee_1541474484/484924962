Oh your happy? 👋 (life) "not anymore"
How do you make a decision like this. Both answers could make me miserable in the end.
Work at my store wouldn't suck so bad if we all actually helped each other and acted like we were all human beings with feelings.
The one thing that makes me happy is tearing me apart
Sponge bob every morning! 👍

A rose and a love note? #nightmade 😍
I can't help you fix yourself but atleast I can say I tried, I've got to move on with my own life
Sometimes I feel special then bam gone.
Some people really care about you, it just takes being disappointed or not to find out who.
My voice went away :( come back I miss you. Haha
