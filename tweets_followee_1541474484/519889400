I love my Moroccan husband.💋
Dip it and do it.
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs. 🇺🇸
Give me one dirt road.
That girl, she's the walk on the wild side.
This is how we roll this is how we do we're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon.
Every now and then you gotta raise a little he'll.
Memory lane up in the headlights, it's got me reminiscing on them good times.
She's my kind of rain like love from a drunken sky.
You can find me where the music meets the ocean.
Being skinny might be nice, but having pizza is nicer.
It's not a kingdom if there's no queen to hold it together.
Love your parents. We are so busy growing up, we often forget they are also getting old.
I am not anti-social, I am selectively social.
A hoodie and underwear is all you really need to wear tbh.
Can bob the builder fix ur shitty attitude.
Pizza is an acceptable meal at all times of the day.🍕🍕#ItalianProblems
If you want to get on my nerves wear skinny jeans with running shoes.
I wish I could lose weight as fast as I lose motivation.
I don't want a job I just want paychecks.$$
Wearing all black today to mourn the death of my motivation.
She's got her daddy's tongue and temper, sometimes her mouth could use a filter, god shook his head the day he built her.
