@SpeakerBoehner and you keep caving in to him. You're more at fault than he is. Try conservatism.

@SportsNation you'd expect more from a QB. But, it doesn't matter if u win or lose. It matters how good u look.
@johnboehner @TeamBoehner  I guess @tedcruz was right. Lets mix in some conservatism this year. You're about to lose my support and $$$$$$$
@SenJohnMcCain switch parties and take @GovChristie with you.
@NBPC2554 and that's why your AUO was cut. Pay people to stay home and do nothing. Pay reform? Hahaha. Suckas.
@latimes you spelled "illegal alien" wrong. The real loser is the legal citizen who git bumped from law school for this guy. #8USC1325
RT @ESPN_Colin: I know this is difficult for SEC fans to accept but the PAC 12 isn't bad.  The fifth bowl BLOWOUT win.
@BarackObama before #Obamacare , nothing was wrong with my health insurance.
@SpeakerBoehner bipartisan? You guys are just democrats light.
Thx 4 punishing retired military.
How do you know when @BarackObama is lying? His lips are moving.
My health care and insurance were fine til you came along.
@espn Mack Brown isn't dead. We knew this was going to happen weeks ago. Get back to highlights on sportscenter.
@HuffingtonPost gun free zones are kill boxes. Ban abortion it kills more kids than guns.
@HuffingtonPost damn global warming
@TIME Then we're in store for lots of "my's," "me's" and "I's"
@billmaher prove it. You can't.  Sheeple
@tedcruz and that's why he wants to raise the minimum wage.  Bribery is the Chicago way.
