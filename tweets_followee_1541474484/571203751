Avoiding relatives aka locking myself in my bedroom until they leave
Lol I can't dance what am I doing
Lost count of the amount of times I have just wanted to give up
Tired 😞
Dammit it was supposed to be a 20 minute nap, not a 4 hour one
Just woke up ☺️
I finally get a lay in tomorrow I'm sooooo happy
I like to get stressed out and then instead of doing something about it, I just tweet about how stressed I am
Breakdowns are becoming a daily thing for me
My talent is being able to fit 3 whole Pringles in my mouth at once
