Avoiding your problems won't solve them
You can only care about what people think for so long until you stop giving a fuck
I'll forgive you but I'll never forget what you did .
I should've never trusted you
Its amazing how someone can go from meaning everything to meaning nothing so easily
I never thought we would end up like this /:

How I Met Your Mother is over forever &amp; I'm not okay with this ):

When you're so upset you feel sick &lt;&lt;
RT @ohteenquotes: In the end, it all comes down to the fact that I cared too much, and you didn't care enough... or at all, really.
