RT @SarahMillican75: Great time in Bradford. Thanks for coming if you did. *five Mars bars*
Such a talented actor, can't believe he has died. RIP Paul Walker.
The only word to even begin to describe last night is insane.
Getting in the mood for the Beehive &amp; Gill's house party afterwards now!
@luke_howarthl20 since you don't have Facebook, thought I'd show you some of the beautiful photos I've just seen... http://t.co/fH9UyacT8M
Why does every single stupid thing or serious decision you've ever made cross your mind when you're trying to sleep? -_-
Love sleeping in when you have morning free's. XD It's just relying on your bastard friends to sign you in...

RT @jess_hamiltonx: Why do I always want what I can't have
Been in such a good mood the past couple of weeks, I think it's the effect of not having to go to that hell hole of a school every day.
First time in ages that I've actually woke up in a really good mood :)
@gym4all Just joined online, what do I do about a membership card or anything I need to be able to get into the gym?
@Bajasession Took a few days to remember, but a promise is a promise!
@NathanKarlGill True, okay I'll ignore him. Especially since the fool doesn't even know how to delete your name and keeps tagging you :/
@NathanKarlGill No because they get a new doctor every 5 minutes, what's the point?
@NathanKarlGill Yeah, but I have 2 older brothers and can never stick to that rule. I'm too stubborn, I hate to lose :/

@D00DY_T00DY @NathanKarlGill I hate you -_- &amp; that picture with the 'What up Buttercup?' was the most disturbing thing I have ever seen!
@NathanKarlGill @D00DY_T00DY Right... so it is the nobhead that is called Michael Dickson?
@D00DY_T00DY @NathanKarlGill  Then who is it then? He's followed by 10 people at 6th form so I just guessed?
@D00DY_T00DY Please tell me that this is not Michael Dixon?!
Well... that weather escalated quickly! As soon as my Mum said "Want to come to Asda with me?". Sure Mum I'm just gonna get my armbands o.O
