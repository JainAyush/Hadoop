Oh I'm just a girl
Tryna find a place in this world
You're a Hollywood dream.
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand and the beat in my face.
If "happy ever" after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All these fairy tales are full of shit
One more stupid love song I'll be sick
Be my number one girl (8)
Acceptance is the key to be, to be truly free. Will you do the same for me ?__(Unconditionally)
Please don't judge me, and I won't judge you (8)
Cry me a river (8)
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see (8)
Yo les thugs.
You Only Live Once #YOLO ;-)
Better day will come, shorty... #AlwayskeepHope
