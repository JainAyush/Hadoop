Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.
I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.
It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.
To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.
Insanity is doing the same thing, over and over again, but expecting different results..( Albert Einstein )
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.....( Mae West )
Admit it, we all have someone’s number in our phone that the other person doesn't know we have it. ;D.
Because of you, I can fight against the world just to be with you.
We are only given today and never promised tomorrow. So be sure to tell someone you love them.
Close your eyes, clear your heart, let it go.
Dear Heart, fall in love when you're ready, not when you're lonely.
