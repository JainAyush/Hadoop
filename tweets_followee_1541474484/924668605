Throughout my life, I've always been afraid of losing people I love. Sometimes I wonder, is there anyone out there afraid to lose me?
To be honest, I really don't give a fuck. I lose friends, make friends and make enemies everyday. Regardless, I'm still going to be me.
I respect those that tell me the truth, no matter how hard it is.

The sweetest things you can do for a girl are the little things that let her know she's in your heart and on your mind. #truth üëèüôå‚úå
If I hadn't met you, I wouldn't like you.
If I hadn't liked you, I wouldn't love you.
If I hadn't loved you, I wouldn't miss you.

I really don't expect or ask much from people. Just loyalty and honesty.
Fall in love with someone that truly deserves your heart, not someone who plays with it.
RT @ItsLifeFact: Don't fall in love with someone who says the right things, fall in love with someone who does the right things.
I think part of the reason why we hold on to something so tight is because we fear something so great would never happen again.
I always wonder what people think of me when they first see me, or how I look from someone else's eyes.
You're my ex. That means I no longer owe you any answers. Don't worry about who I'm with now. It's not you.
