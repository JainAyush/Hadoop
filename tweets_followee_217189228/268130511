Being in a bad mood, and going through the newsfeed on Facebook saying "nobody cares" over and over in your head. (:
I hate it when you pick up the phone and think you've pressed talk but it rings again really loud next to your ear

Since us girls have that one guy we will never get over, i wonder if boys have that one girl they will never get over ♥

I hate it when people try to whisper to me and the teacher is looking right at us...
One day my patience will run out...... and I will punch you........ Really Hard.... In the face.....
'You're so pretty!" "No Im not!" "Okay you're ugly" "Excuse me?" Thats what happens when you don't accept the compliment.
